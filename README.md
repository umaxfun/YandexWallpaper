YandexWallpaper
===============

This tool automates setting today's Yandex.Images wallpaper to your desktop.

#What is it all about
Yandex Image Search (http://images.yandex.ru) daily publishes one pretty wallpaper. You can download a wallpaper manually and set it to your desktop by hands OR download this tool, put it to the desktop and click an icon each time you get bored by your current one.

###Changelog
####Release 1.2 / 25.11.2014
First public release with features:

1. Download today's wallpaper from Yandex.Images, 1920x1080
2. Set new shiny wallpaper to every monitor with 'Fill' mode enabled (no uglifying, just fill the screen)
3. YWP uses IE proxy for download purposes
4. If your proxy is protected by login/password (and login/password are not saved in IE), YWP asks for them. No hard drive credentials caching is performed.
